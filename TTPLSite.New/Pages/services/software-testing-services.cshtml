                    <p>
                        TTPL has assembled Test-lets based on several security test types that are employed
                        explicitly for Security testing. It includes testing for data security breaches such as XSS-
                        Cross-Site Scripting, SQLI, IDOR- Insecure Direct Object Reference, Broken Authentication
                        and Session Management, CSRF - Cross-Site Request Forgery, Security Misconfiguration, and
                        security vulnerability, Insecure Cryptographic Storage Vulnerabilities, Insufficient
                        Transport Layer Protection, and Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards.

                    <p>
                        Access control testing is performed to give specific types of users permission-based access
                        of the system; our skilled QA security testers go through all the test cases to ensure that
                        there no data leakage
                    </p>
                    <span>Penetration Testing</span>
                    <p>
                        Penetration testing technique is applied to detect security weakness and formulate an
                        in-depth analysis of security flaws to get your product secure from vulnerabilities in point
                        of fact
